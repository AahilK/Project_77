        <p>Hi this is about Visual Studio Code(VSC) it is a coding program used to code with many different coding languages. This is how to open VSC (Visual studio code). First is to search up, "Visual Studio Code", next download the first thing you see. Then open up the visualcode.exe when installed. Afterwards you're in but if you want to code and test it you go to extensions all the way on the left with 3 boxes and 1 in the top right. Then search up Live server. Click the purple live server icon then find the download button and press it. Once you installed it you can see a go live button in the bottom right. You can click on files and then new file or folder for which ever one you made and start making the code. If you don't know how to look up a video because (My fingers are hurting).

        var fullname = firstname.concat(secondname)
        console.log(fullname)
        
        console.log(fullname.length)
        console.log(firstname.length)
        console.log(secondname.length)

        console.log(fullname.toLowerCase())
        
        console.log(Math.sqrt(225))
        console.log(Math.max(50 , 5))
        console.log(Math.min(5 , 50))
        console.log(Math.pow(2 , 1))
